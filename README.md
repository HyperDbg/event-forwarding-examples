# Event Forwarding
Examples of using the "Event Forwarding" mechanism in HyperDbg

- Event forwarding is a feature designed to make HyperDbg a tool for log gathering and analyzing system behavior. This way, you can use HyperDbg for #DFIR purposes.
- You can use event forwarding to forward the event monitoring result from your internal system to an external source, e.g., **File**, **NamedPipe**, **TCP Socket**, or **DLL (binary) module**.
